The Employee Database System is a MySQL-based project designed to manage and streamline various aspects of employment-related data. It includes functionalities for storing and retrieving employee information, managing job postings, and tracking job applications. Built using MySQL Workbench, the project ensures efficient data handling by implementing relational integrity through foreign key constraints. The system allows users to track the status of job applications (e.g., Submitted, In Review, Accepted, Rejected) and supports scalability for future features, such as adding more employee-related data or automating application reviews. The primary goal of the system is to provide an easy-to-use yet robust framework for managing the employment lifecycle, making it ideal for small to medium-sized organizations or as a learning project for database design and SQL query optimization.
